1. The scientific method - overview

2. Machine learning
Basic concepts:
- Computer learning from data

Types:
- Supervised learning - regression, classification
- Unsupervised learning - the program finds patterns in data - clustering analysis, dimensionality reduction
- Reinforcement learning - Form of unsupervised, the program learns continuously - e.g. the program is playing a game

Algorithms by task(models) overview:
- Statistical algorithms
- Regression - predicting a continuous variable
- Classification - predicting class labels
- Clustering - finding compact groups of data points
- Dimensionality reduction - simplifying the input data
- Optimization - minimize / maximize a target function
- Testing and improvement algorithms - fine tuning and optimization of ML algos - meta-learning

scikit-learn - ML models
numpy, scipy, matplotlib

3. Data management
