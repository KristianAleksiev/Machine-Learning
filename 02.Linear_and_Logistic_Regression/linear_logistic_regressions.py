"""
1. Machine learning basics
- Objective function
- Cost function
- Optimization

2. Linear regression
- Algorithm
parameters of the model - they change during the process of learning (gradient descent coefficients)
Optimal steps => optimal result => Greedy algorithms
- Usage
MSE, sqrt(MSE) - no gradient

3. RANSAC
- Randomized Sample Consensus - Removing the outliers
- Testing a few models for outliers

4. Polynomial regression
- Precompute the columns

5. Logistic regression
- Algorithm- Predict one of several known classes, based on the input params
- Usage
